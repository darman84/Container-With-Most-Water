Given n non-negative integers a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>, ..., a<sub>n</sub> , where each represents a point at coordinate (i, a<sub>i</sub>). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, a<sub>i</sub>) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Note: You may not slant the container and n is at least 2.

The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.

 

Example:

Input: [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
